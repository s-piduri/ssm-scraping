[More specific] Instructions for setting up Docker and RSelenium:

1. Make sure VT-x is turned on in System BIOS
2. Install Docker Desktop
3. Add user to docker-users in "local users and groups"
    - to do this, open terminal as an administrator
    - net localgroup "docker-users" "<MemberName>" /add
    - or run lusrmgr.msc using Run command to pull up local users and group edit 
    - you can't add your username if you're using a laptop because the OS is utilizing a MS azure. You have to add a stand-in name like Authenticated Users or Interactive (talk to CTSS to get this done)
4. Download and install RSelenium in R: install.packages('RSelenium', repos='https://cran.r-project.org')
5. Start Docker
6. In order to run Docker, you may have to install Linux. Follow the instructions prompted.
7. Run in Powershell: docker pull selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.0
8. Make sure Rtools is installed
   - add Rtools to path within R - for some reason, if this isn't done, the code doesn't work
   - run in R: writeLines('PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"', con = "~/.Renviron")
   - restart R so changes can take effect
9. make sure that the destination folder is set here "~/Downloads/Selenium-Downloads/"
   - create a folder with this name in this path
10. Run in powershell: docker run -d -v ~/Downloads/Selenium-Downloads/://home/seluser/Downloads -p 4445:4444 -p 5901:5900 selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.0
